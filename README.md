Hi, Iâ€™m @edgarpavao

Graduated in Information Systems in 2006, I worked as a developer analyst, engineer and software architect almost all this time in projects in the ERP area, mainly in the sugar-alcohol and civil construction areas.

I'm a programming enthusiast. I started early, at age 12, and never stopped. I love what I do.
